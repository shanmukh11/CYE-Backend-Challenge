# ðŸ“§ CYE Backend Challenge - Email Server (Submitted by Shanmukh Swaroop Srinivas)

In this task, Python, [FastAPI], and [SQLite3] are used to create an email
microservice. This API presents a JSON interface to let us create, read,
update, and destroy email objects in a local database.

## Email Schema

Emails are represented with the following properties:

- `id` (integer, read-only)
    - Automatically-selected unique identifier for the email.
- `body` (string)
    - Email message.
- `subject` (string, max 50 chars)
    - Email subject consisting of up to 50 characters.
- `sender` (string)
    - Sender's email address.
- `recipient` (string)
    - Recipient's email address.
- `has_attachments` (bool)
    - Whether this email has attachments.
- `created` (datetime, read-only)
    - Automatically-set time at which this email was created. When
      representing as JSON, use any well-known string format (the output of
      `str`, illustrated below, is fine).

Here is an example as JSON.

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "body": "Good luck!",
    "subject": "CYE Interview Challenge",
    "sender": "johndoe@umass.edu",
    "recipient": "you@umass.edu",
    "has_attachments": 1,
    "created": "2021-03-15 14:31:32.733388"
}
```

## API Specification

This API uses a local SQLite database called [`email.db`](./email.db).

##### GET `/emails`

Gets an array of all emails in the database. It is also sorted in the descending order of created time. (Newest first)

Sample output JSON:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 2,
        "body": "Second body",
        "subject": "Test subject",
        "sender": "johndoe123@umass.edu",
        "recipient": "you123@umass.edu",
        "has_attachments": 0,
        "created": "2021-03-16 14:31:32.733388"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "body": "Good luck!",
        "subject": "CYE Interview Challenge",
        "sender": "johndoe@umass.edu",
        "recipient": "you@umass.edu",
        "has_attachments": 1,
        "created": "2021-03-15 14:31:32.733388"
    }
]
```

##### POST `/emails`

Creates one new email with given info, auto-assigns it an ID, and saves it to the
database. `created` time is set automatically.

Sample input JSON:

```json
{
    "body": "Third body",
    "subject": "Random subject",
    "sender": "mikeoliver@umass.edu",
    "recipient": "jack@umass.edu",
    "has_attachments": 0
}
```

##### GET `/emails/{id:int}`

Get the email from the database with primary key `id`. Note that `{id:int}` is
a placeholder for an integer value. GET `/email/1` would try to get the email
with ID 1.

Sample output JSON for GET `/emails/2`:

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "body": "Second body",
    "subject": "Test subject",
    "sender": "johndoe123@umass.edu",
    "recipient": "you123@umass.edu",
    "has_attachments": 0,
    "created": "2021-03-16 14:31:32.733388"
}
```
##### PATCH `/emails/{id:int}`

Updates writable fields on the email with the given ID. A request to this
endpoint might look like this. The endpoint would update the fields specified
in the body. 

Sample output JSON for PATCH `/emails/2`:

```json
{
    "sender": "janedoe@umass.edu",
    "has_attachments": 1
}
```

Sample output JSON for GET `/emails/2` after PATCH:

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "body": "Second body",
    "subject": "Test subject",
    "sender": "janedoe@umass.edu",
    "recipient": "you123@umass.edu",
    "has_attachments": 1,
    "created": "2021-03-16 14:31:32.733388"
}
```


##### DELETE `/emails/{id:int}`

Deletes the email with the given ID.


## Environment Setup

You will need a recent (3.7+) version of Python for this challenge. The code uses [Pipenv] for dependency and script management. The following
should be enough to set up and enter a development environment:

```sh
$ pip install pipenv
$ pipenv install --dev
$ pipenv shell
```

When it comes time to start the server, use the following command:

```sh
$ pipenv run start
```

## Testing

The `tests/` directory contains a sample [PyTest] test. You are free and
encouraged to add more tests.

Run the tests using:

```sh
$ pipenv run test
```

## Optional: Bonus Tasks

- Disallow newline (`\n`) characters in the `subject` field - Done
- Add email format validation for the `sender` and `recipient` fields - Done
- Use SQLAlchemy instead of directly using the SQLite3 module.
- Sort the result of GET `/emails` by created date (newest first). - Done
- Add the following query parameters to GET `/emails`: - Done
    - `/emails?sender=X`: Emails sent by `X`.
    - `/emails?recipient=X`: Emails received by `X`.
    - `/emails?before=X`: Emails created before date `X`.
